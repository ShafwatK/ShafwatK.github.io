    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction:</strong>  <br>
    The shop currently has 2 CNC lasers that they use. Each laser has complexing wiring to power all components as well as feed the gas to the laser. 
    As it stands the wiring is a mess and it is hard to tell which wire goes where, it also poses a tripping hazard.
    My job is to design a system to manage all of these cables. I need to reroute the wires in a more organized manner to make them easier to track and safer to work around.
        <br>

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Planning:</strong>  <br>
    I started by taking pictures of and documenting the existing wiring. I made a general diagram of how the wires are routed and where they go.
    The optimal way to re route the wires would be to run them overhead, this would totoally eliminate the tripping hazard and also make it easier to track the wires.
    To simplify my design, my best bet would be to make use of existing infastructure. The 2 easiest structures to use would be the ceilling beams and the existing machines.
    The ceilling beams are quite high, this would require the use of chains to hang the platform, adding complexity and compromising stability.
    The machines were lower, but they are too low and they might get in the way of tall people.
    My solution: use an elevated gutter system to run wires above the machines. I decided to use the chiller which was in the back of the laser as my main stand.
        <br>

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Designing:</strong>  <br>
    The design was simple, make something like a gutter with a stand that i can screw on to the existing machine. (images to the right)    
    I made the design in SolidWorks and I used the dimensions of the existing machine to make sure it would fit perfectly. 
    My plan was to run the wires through the gutter and then use zip ties to hold them in place. 
    Keeping the wires overhead would also make it much easier to route them to their respective locations. 
    <br>

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Installation:</strong>  <br>
    Now comes the hard part, actually installing the system and rerouting the wires.
    I had to wait for the machine to be free, once it was turned off I carefully removed a screw from the machine. This screw was reinstalled with the base of the stand under it.
    This was my way of attaching the stand without drilling any additional holes into the machine.
    Once the stand was on I screwed the gutters on to the stands.
    Rerouting the wires was hard work. I had to wait for a time where the laser was not being used, then I had to carefully disconnect each wire and route it through the gutter and then reconnect it.
    This was done with a lot of help from the laser technician in the shop. The process took approximately 2 hours to complete.
    <br>
    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Results:</strong>  <br>
    At the end the project was a success, the wires were all routed through the gutter and they no longer posed as a tripping hazard.
    The wires were also much easier to track and it was easy to see which wire went where.
    The shop currently still uses that system and it has held up well since my term there.
