            The shop currently has two CNC lasers in use. Each laser requires complex wiring for power and gas supply.  
            At the time, the wiring was messy and created a serious tripping hazard, while also making it difficult to track which wire connected where.  
            My task was to design a system to manage these cables by rerouting them in a more organized way, improving safety and efficiency.

            I began by documenting the existing wiring and creating a diagram of how cables were routed.  
            The best option was to run wires overhead, eliminating tripping hazards and making tracking easier.  
            To keep the design simple, I planned to reuse existing infrastructure. The ceiling beams were too high and would require chains, reducing stability.  
            Instead, I decided to use the chiller at the back of the laser as the main support and run the wires above the machines using a raised gutter system.

            The design was straightforward: build a gutter-like channel supported by stands that could attach directly to the machine.  
            I modeled the design in SolidWorks using exact machine dimensions to ensure a perfect fit.  
            The plan was to run wires through the gutter and secure them with zip ties, keeping everything elevated and neatly routed to their destinations.

            Installation required waiting until the laser was idle. I carefully removed an existing screw from the machine, then reinstalled it with the base of the stand underneath.  
            This allowed me to secure the gutter system without drilling new holes into the machine.  
            Once the stands were mounted, I attached the gutters and began rerouting the wires.  
            Each wire had to be disconnected, passed through the gutter, and reconnected with the help of the shopâ€™s laser technician.  
            The process took about two hours to complete.

            The project was a success. All wires were routed through the gutter, removing the tripping hazard and making the wiring much easier to track.  
            The shop continues to use the system today, and it has held up well since installation.
