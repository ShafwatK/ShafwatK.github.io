      <p>
        The welding section at Sable Metal needed an exhaust fan to improve ventilation and air quality. The existing fume hoods did not draw in enough air.  
        I was tasked with getting an exhaust fan installed in the welding booth. To start, I inspected the existing ventilation system to figure out the necessary steps.  
        After some research and inspection, I realized I needed to:  <br>
        - Calculate the CFM requirements for the booth  <br>
        - Select an appropriate fan  <br>
        - Design and fabricate a mount  <br>
        - Install the fan
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Research</h2>
      <p>
        Before choosing a fan, I needed to understand the basics of ventilation systems. I learned that one of the most important factors is the CFM (cubic feet per minute) rating of the fan. The exhaust fan must match the airflow of the intake fans; otherwise, it can overwork them.  
        I also discovered that CFM ratings are usually measured with still air, but in practice, the exhaust would be pulling moving air. This meant I could use a fan with a slightly lower rating, as long as it wasn’t too low to cause backflow.  
        Measuring the intake fans, I found each was rated at 1700 CFM. Since they were connected in parallel, the total airflow was still 1700 CFM, but with increased static pressure. Because static pressure wasn’t a concern in this case, my target was simply to match ~1700 CFM for the exhaust.

      <p>
        I compared different fans by CFM ratings, price, and compatibility with the existing 12-inch duct.  
        I learned that the intake fans had been purchased from All Grow Garden, a store close to us, so I started there. After reviewing options, I chose a wall-mount exhaust fan rated at 2000 CFM with a speed controller. This allowed me to adjust it down to around 1700 CFM, ensuring it matched the intake fans.  
        The fan also came in a 12-inch size, which made installation straightforward.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Installation</h2>
      <p>
        Installation was my favorite part of the project. I first looked at how the existing duct was mounted: a chain every meter or so. While simple, this wouldn’t work for the fan due to potential vibration.  
        I measured the ceiling railing and designed two “A” shaped brackets with bends at the bottom to hold the fan securely. These were mounted to the railing and adjusted so the fan connected seamlessly to the duct. Duct tape was added to minimize air leaks and keep the connection tight.  
        Finally, I wired the fan into the same outlet as the intake fans so that all fans would turn on and off together.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Results</h2>
      <p>
        After installation, I tested the system while welders were working. The airflow in the fume hood was significantly stronger, and the exhaust effectiveness was noticeably improved.  
        This confirmed that the fan was properly balanced with the intake system, making the booth safer and more efficient.
