    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction:</strong>  <br>
        The welding section at Sable Metal was in need of an exhaust fan to help with ventilation and air quality, the current fume hoods did not draw in enough air. 
        I was tasked with doing whatever was required to get an exhaust fan installed in the welding booth.
        I started by looking into the existing ventlation system to figure out what steps were required to get the exhaust fan installed.
        After some inspection and research into the existing ventilation system, I figured out that I would need to calculate the CFM requirements for the welding booth, pick out an appropriate fan, design a mount for it, fabricate the mount, and install it.
        <br>

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Research:</strong>  <br>
        Before looking into fans, I needed to figure out the basics of ventlation systems. I researched online into how ventilation systems work and how air flow behaves.
        I soon figured out that one of the most important factor in a ventilation system is the CFM (cubic feet per minute) rating of the fan. The exhaust fan needs to match the airdflow of the intake fans, or else it can overwork the intake fans.
        I learned that CFM is rated using still air, but in reality the exhause fan would be pulling in moving air, so I could get away with having a lower CFM rating on the exhaust fan. 
        It is also essential to make sure that the exhaust fan CFM rating is not too low, or else it would cause backflow against the intake fans which would end up being worse than having no fan.
        With this in mind I started looking into the existing fans, I measured the dimensions of the intake fans and looked up their CFM ratings online.
        I found out that the intake fans were rated at 1700 CFM each, and there were two of them, but the two fans were connected in parallel.
        I learned that when fans are connected in parallel, the CFM rating stays the same, but the static pressure increases. When fans are connected in series, the CFM ratings add up, but the static pressure stays the same.
        This meant that the total CFM rating of the intake fans was 1700 CFM, and the static pressure was doubled. I did not have to worry about the static pressure so this made my job much easier.

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Fan Shopping:</strong>  <br>
        I started looking into fans that would be appropriate for the welding booth, I looked at a variety of different fans and compared their CFM ratings, and prices while making sure that the dimensions (12" diameter) fit on the existing duct.
        It occured to me that the best place to start would be by looking at where we bought the existing intake fans from. I asked my boss where the intake fans were bought from and he told me that they were bought from All Grow Garden, a store very close to us.
        After comparing a few different fans, I settled on a fan that was rated at 2000 CFM, but with a speed controller that allowed me to  adjust it to approximately 1700 CFM.
        The fan was a 20 inch wall mount exhaust fan, which would be easy to install in the welding booth.

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Installation:</strong>  <br>
        Now the final and my personal favourite part of the project, the installation. I started by taking note of how the existing duct was mounted, it was a simple chain holding up the duct every meter or so. I realised that this would not work for a fan as it may vibrate more.
        I decided to take inspiration from the existing duct and use a similar mounting method, but with a more robust and secure design. I measured the railing on the cieling, this is where I would connect the bracket to.
        I designed 2 simple brackets with an "A" shape and a bend at the bottom to hold the fan. These brackets were then mounted to the railing and adjusted so that the fan connected seamlessly to the duct. It was later wrapped in duct tape to minimize air leaks and secure the fan to the duct.
        The fan was then connected to an extension cord which was plugged into the same power outlet as the intake fans, this way the exhaust fan would turn on and off with the intake fans.

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Results:</strong>  <br>
        After the installation was completed I decided to test the results while the welders where at work. I noticed a hugely increased airflow in the welding fume hood as well as a much stronger exhaust.
