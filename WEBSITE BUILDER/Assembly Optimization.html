    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction:</strong>  <br>
    One of the biggest orders for Sable Metal was for a large number of doors.
    The doors were to be assembled in the shop and then shipped out to the customer.
    The existing assembly process was slow and inefficient, I was tasked with optimizing the process and documenting the steps so that it could be easily repeated.
        <br>

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Documentations:</strong>  <br>
    My process started with working closely with the assembly team to understand the existing process.
    I took notes and pictures of each step, and later I created a detailed document outlining each step of the process as well as the time it took.
    Through out the process I identified bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
    One of the most prominent issues was the lack of aid for drilling. 
    The assembly team had to hand measure every new hole, this was time consuming and prone to error.
    The next biggest issue was the fact that the hardware that was installed was not the same dimensions as the ones on the CAD.
        <br>

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Modifications:</strong>  <br>
    After identifying the issues I started to work on solutions.
    To solve the issue with the drilling I designed jigs that would be held against other parts of the door to allow the team to match drill.
    
    <br>

    <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Results:</strong>  <br>
    By the end of the modifications the assembly was optimized, cutting the total time from 4 and a half hours to 4 hours, taking 88% of the original time.
