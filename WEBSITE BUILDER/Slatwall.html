      <p>
        The company had recently created its welding section, which was in desperate need of upgrades. I was tasked with talking to the welding team and understanding their needs. One of the biggest issues was the lack of space to store tools and equipment. Their space was very disorganized and being used inefficiently.  
        I learned that a very effective way to optimize space is to use vertical storage, which is when I decided to make use of the wall and create a slatwall and a slatwall shelf.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Planning Process</h2>
      <p>
        First, I looked into existing slatwall designs around the shop and online, trying to find creative solutions that would be cheap and easy to implement. I noticed that all the slatwalls around the shop were made of wood. This would not be a good idea for the welding section, as wood and heat typically do not mix well.  
        I decided to use metal for the slatwall and shelf. This would be more durable and resistant to the heat and sparks from welding. I found several metal slatwall designs online, but they were very expensive, so I realized I could make my own design that would be cheaper and give me more flexibility.  
        To simplify manufacturing, I changed the design from the complex folded style commonly used to a simpler flat sheet of metal with slots cut into it. These slots would allow accessories to be mounted using a hook design. This made the slatwall much easier and more cost-effective to produce.

      <p class="mt-4">
        The problem with existing slatwall designs is that they rely on a folded structure that is difficult to manufacture. My simplified design allowed for more cost-effective production while still meeting strength requirements.  
        I determined the slot dimensions based on available wall space in the welding stations. Using force simulation software, I tested different spacing and chose the layout that balanced strain across the wall and shelf. My final design is shown below.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Assembly</h2>
      <p>
        The assembly plan was simple: screw 1/4-20 bolts into each corner of the slatwall. The bolts, 2.5 inches long, would go through the slatwall and extend out the other side of the wall, allowing another slatwall to be mounted on the opposite side.  
        Execution, however, was not as straightforward. Drilling the holes required the drill to be perfectly straight and aligned; otherwise, the screws would go in crooked, making it difficult to hang the opposite slatwall. Despite my efforts, the holes were slightly misaligned. But whatâ€™s the fun in engineering if everything goes according to plan?  
        To compensate, I drilled with a slightly larger bit to allow for margin of error. Washers were added on both ends for extra support. Using a hammer, I carefully bent the screws to align them with the opposite slatwall. Since the holes were slightly larger than the screws, the bolts could still be removed if needed, despite the bends.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Final Result</h2>
      <p>
        With the slatwall installed, I was able to start designing the slatwall shelf. Instead of following a generic shelf design, I focused on creating custom pegs for each tool to maximize vertical space usage. This approach aligned with LEAN principles and made the welding station more efficient and organized.
