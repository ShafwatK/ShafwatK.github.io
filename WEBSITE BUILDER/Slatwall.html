        <p>
          The company had recently created its welding section, which was in desperate need of upgrades.  
          One of the biggest issues was the lack of space to store tools and equipment — the area was disorganized and inefficient.  
          I spoke with the welding team to understand their needs and quickly realized that vertical storage would be the most effective solution.  
          This led to the design and installation of a custom slatwall and shelf system.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700">Planning Process</h2>
        <p>
          I first researched existing slatwall designs in the shop and online, aiming for something both cost-effective and easy to manufacture.  
          Most were made of wood, which wasn’t suitable for the welding environment due to heat and sparks.  
          Instead, I opted for a custom metal design that would be durable, heat-resistant, and flexible.  
        </p>

        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
          <img src="Slatwall_online.jpg" alt="Slatwall found online" class="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-xl shadow-lg">
          <img src="Slatwall_side.jpg" alt="Sideview of slatwall" class="w-full h-64 object-cover rounded-xl shadow-lg">
        </div>

        <p>
          Unlike complex folded structures, I simplified the design to a flat metal sheet with precision-cut slots.  
          This reduced costs while maintaining strength and ease of use.  
          Using simulation software, I optimized slot spacing to balance strain across the wall and shelf.  
          Below is the final SolidWorks model of my design.

        <p>
          The assembly plan was simple: secure the slatwall with 1/4-20 bolts through each corner, extending to mount another slatwall on the opposite side.  
          Execution, however, introduced challenges — drilling required perfect alignment, and some holes were misaligned.  
          To fix this, I used a slightly larger drill bit for tolerance, reinforced with washers, and carefully bent bolts with a hammer for alignment.  
          This maintained both strength and removability despite small errors in drilling.

          <p>
            With the slatwall installed, I designed custom shelves and pegs tailored for each tool.  
            This maximized vertical space usage, reduced clutter, and followed <strong>LEAN principles</strong> for workplace organization.  
            The welding section became significantly more efficient and professional.
