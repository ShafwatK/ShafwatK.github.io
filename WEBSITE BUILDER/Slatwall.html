  <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction:</strong>  <br>
    The company has newly created their welding section and it is in desperate need of upgrades. I was tasked with talking to the welding team and understanding their needs.
    One of the biggest issues was the lack of space to store their tools and equipment. Their space was very disorganized and their space was being used inefficiently. 
    I learned that a very effective way to use space is to use verticle space, which is when I decided to make use of the wall and create a slatwall and a slatwall shelf.

    <br>
  <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Planning process:</strong>  <br>
    First I looked into existing slatwall designs around the shop and online, I was trying to find creative solutions that would be cheap and easy to implement. 
    I noticed that all the slatwalls around the shop were made of wood, this would not be a good idea for the welding section as wood and heat typically do not mix well.
    I decided to use metal for the slatwall and the shelf, this would be more durable and would not be affected by the heat or sparts from the welding. 
    I looked online for metal slatwall designs and found a few that I liked, but they were all very expensive and I realized that I could make my own design that would be cheaper and give me more flexibility.
    I decided to change my design from the commonly used slatwalls in order to make it easier to manufacture.

  The problem with existing slatwall designs is that they have a complex folded design that is difficult to manufacture.
  I decided to change the design to a simpler one that is easier to manufacture and will be more cost effective.
  My design is a simple flat sheet of metal with slots cut out into it, these slots will allow for accessories to be mounted onto the slatwall with a clever hook design.
  This design is much easier to manufacture and will be more cost effective.
  <br>
  My design is shown on the right.
  The dimensions of the slatwall were based on the existing space available in the welding stations, the slot cut outs were dimensioned somewhat arbitrarily.
  I test different spacing and dimensioning on a force simulation software and picked the spacing that worked well to balance out strain on the shelf and wall.

  <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Assembly:</strong>  <br>
  The assembly plan was simple, screw in 1/4-20 bolts into each corner of the slatwall, the bolts would be 2.5 inches long, it would go through the slatwall and come out of the other side of the wall so that we could hang up another slatwall on the opposite side.
  The execution was not as simple as the plan, I used a drill to drill holes into the wall but the main challange was making sure that the drill was completely straight and alligned perfectly.
  Any slight misalignment would cause the screws to go in crooked making it very difficult to hand the slatwall on the other side of the wall.
  Keeping this in mind I tried my best to make the allignment as perfect as possible, but I unfortunatelly did not succeed, the holes were slightly misalligned. 
  But what is the fun in engineering if everything goes according to plan? 
  <br>
  To make up for the misalignment I drilled the hole with a larger sized drill bit to allow for a larger margin or error. I used a washer on both ends to add additional support.
  Using a hammer I was able to bend the screws slightly to make them alligned with the slatwall on the other side of the wall. Since the hole was slightly larger than the screw, it was still possible to pull out when needed, despite the bend.

  <strong style="font-size: 24px;">Final result:</strong>  <br>
  Now that the slatwall was installed, I was able to start designing the slatwall shelf, but I decided to work on a different design to maximaize space efficiency.
  I decided to make custom pegs for each tool to maximize the usage of verticle space, focusing on LEAN principles.
