        <p>
          Before my term started, the shop used an alarm to signal break times.  
          The system stopped working, and I was tasked with diagnosing the issue.  
          I discovered the circuit board of the programmable clock was broken. Replacing it would cost over $300, so I looked for a more affordable alternative.

        <p>
          I explored alternatives and decided to use an Arduino ESP32.  
          The shop bell ran on 24V AC but could also work with DC, so I reused the transformer from the old clock.  
          A relay was added to control the bell and protect the ESP32 from high voltage.  
          I simulated the circuit in Wokwi before making purchases, testing different ESP32 pins.  
          For software, I used the built-in RTC and resynced it every four hours.  
          I also developed a custom app in MIT App Inventor to manually set alarms and control the bell remotely.

    <!-- Shopping List -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-green-700">Shopping List</h2>
        <p>
          I created a shopping list with approximate costs. Key components included:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>ESP32 microcontroller</li>
          <li>Relay module</li>
          <li>Breadboard for testing</li>
          <li>Wire splitters and connection blocks</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The total came to under $100, saving the shop about $200 compared to replacing the clock. All components were sourced from Sayal Electronics.

    <!-- Installation -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-green-700">Installation</h2>
        <p>
          Installation was the most labor-intensive part.  
          I cut and prepared ~25 feet of wire to connect the control unit (“brain”) to the bell.  
          The wire came in a casing with eight strands, which I separated and re-braided into groups of four.  
          I mounted the control unit on the wall and installed the bell on the ceiling for maximum coverage.

        <p>
          After a full day of testing, the buzzer worked reliably.  
          A bug that caused the alarm to trigger twice was quickly fixed.  
          By the end of my internship, the shop fully adopted the new system, which continues to run smoothly today.
