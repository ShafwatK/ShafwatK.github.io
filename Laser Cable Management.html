        <p>
          The shop has two CNC lasers, each requiring complex wiring for power and gas.  
          At the time, the wiring was messy and created a serious tripping hazard, while making it hard to track connections.  
          My task was to design a system to manage these cables, improving safety and efficiency.

    <!-- Planning -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Planning</h2>
      <p>
        I documented existing wiring and created a diagram of cable routing.  
        To eliminate tripping hazards, I planned to run wires overhead using existing infrastructure.  
        The ceiling beams were too high, so I used the chiller at the back of the laser as the main support, running wires above the machines via a raised gutter system.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-green-700">Designing</h2>
        <p>
          The design involved a gutter-like channel supported by stands attached directly to the machine.  
          I modeled it in SolidWorks using exact machine dimensions.  
          Wires were routed through the gutter and secured with zip ties, keeping them neat and elevated.

    <!-- Installation -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-green-700 mb-4">Installation</h2>
      <p>
        Installation was done while the laser was idle. I reused an existing screw to mount the base of the stand without drilling new holes.  
        Once the stands were mounted, gutters were attached and wires rerouted through the system.  
        Each wire was disconnected, passed through the gutter, and reconnected with the technician's help.  
        The process took approximately two hours.

        <p>
          The project successfully removed tripping hazards and improved cable tracking.  
          The system remains in use and has held up well since installation.
